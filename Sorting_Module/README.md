# Sorting Module 
To sort an unsorted list using multiple algorithms. 

## Problem Statement : Build a Sorting Module using python with following requirements :
1) Support Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort. 
2) User can provide an unsorted list and choose any sorting method to apply on it. 
3) A decorator which can measure the time performance of methods or functions. 
4) Unittest cases covering all scenarios and algorithms. <br><br>


## Additional points to take care :  
1) Proper Doc String at every level like function, clases, module. 
2) Logical naming of variables.
